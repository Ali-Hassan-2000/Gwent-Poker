        <h3>Poker Rules</h3>
        <p>Poker is a card game where players make bets based on the rank and strength of their hands. 
            The goal is to win the pot, which is the sum of all bets placed during a hand. Key elements include 
            hand rankings, betting rounds, and the showdown.</p>
